          <div class="recipe-section">
          <div class="instructions instruction-section">Preparation of Chicken Marinade</div>
          <p class="instructions">
            <ul class="instruction-list">
              <li>Break down the whole chicken into two wings, two thighs, and 4 pieces of breast (alternatively, you can just buy a whole cut up chicken from the grocery store which is way easier).  Set aside the chicken.</li>
              <li>Caution: this next step may cause you to tear up so you will want to do this fast, unless you have terrible vision like me and contacts somehow deflect the onion’s powers.  Peel a whole onion and cut off the top of the onion and grate from that end taking care not to grate your fingers. Grate the whole thing on the largest grate setting on the box grater and grate everything (including that onion juice) into a large rubber container large enough to fit the chicken pieces.  Add the fish sauce, salt, pepper, and water to the container with the onion pulp.</li>
              <li>Take your chicken pieces and place them in the container with the marinade and making sure the chicken is well coated with the marinade.  You can let the chicken marinade in the fridge anywhere from 1hr – 8 hrs.  I made this marinade in the morning and prepared the rest of the dish after getting home from work.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        
        <div class="instructions instruction-section">THE CHICKEN</div>
          <p class="instructions">
            <ul class="instruction-list">
              <li>Grab a gallon size ziplock bag and add the corn starch, flour, and seasonings and make sure to combine thoroughly.</li>
              <li>I used the instant pot 8 qt duo with air fryer lid.  Link for the <a href=""https://www.crateandbarrel.com/instant-pot-8-quart-duo-crisp-air-fryer/s590705"">Instant Pot</a> Plug in the air fryer and remove the basket and set aside.  My air fryer is a bit on the small side and can only fit 3 pieces of chicken at a time (1 wing, 1 breast, and 1 thigh) so this recipe wouldn’t take nearly as long as if you have a larger air fryer as you would not need to do as many batches.  Alternatively, you can also try making this recipe in a convection oven if you don’t have an air fryer.</li>
              <li>Grab a piece of chicken from the marinade and shake off any excess marinade and place into the ziplock bag.  Close the bag and shake the piece of chicken around in the bag so the chicken is evenly coated.  Remove the piece of chicken and shake off any extra dusting and place into the air fryer basket.  Repeat with other pieces of chicken to fill the basket.  ​</li>
              <li>Once your basket is full, generously spray the chicken with avocado oil spray or canola oil spray so the pieces are evenly coated.  Place the basket in the air fryer and air fry at 400F for 15 mins.  Open up the air fryer and flip the pieces over and air fry at 400F for another 15 mins.  Each side should be golden brown and place in the oven under warm while you’re air frying the other batches (I place the chicken on a wire rack to preserve the texture of the chicken while it’s in the oven).</li>
              <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 with the other batches of chicken and air fry until all the chicken is air fried.  You can keep air fried pieces in the oven while you’re finish up all the batches or if you’re busy preparing other side dishes for dinner.</li>
              <li>You can prepare the cabbage slaw while you’re waiting on the first batch of chicken and just adding the dressing minutes before you’re about to serve everything.</li>  
            </ul>
          </p>
        
        <div class="instructions instruction-section">The Sauce</div>
          <p class="instructions">
            <ul class="instruction-list">
              <li>You can make this sauce in advance and warm it up before serving or you can start working on this before you start the chicken dredging/frying process.</li>
              <li>Grab a sauce pan and combine all the ingredients and put on the stove on low heat.  Stir periodically to ensure that the sauce doesn’t bubble too much and to warm the ingredients together.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        
        <div class="instructions instruction-section">The Slaw</div>
          <p class="instructions">
            <ul class="instruction-list">
              <li>Use a mandolin on the 3/16 setting to slice the cabbage or use a knife to thinly slice the green and red cabbage.  Add the cabbage to a bowl.</li>
              <li>Optional: cut the chayote squash in half and remove the core piece.  Thinly slice the chayote so the pieces look like matchstick like pieces and add to the bowl with the cabbage.  Chayote squash has a great crunchy texture and has a similar taste to a pear so if you do not have chayote squash, adding apple or pear would be a great substitute.  Note: you can shred the cabbage hours in advance as there will be very little browning or discoloration in the cabbage but if you want to add the chayote squash or apple or pear, you will want to do this right before serving the entire dish as those items will discolor.</li>
              <li>Grab another small bowl or Pyrex measuring cup, and add the lime juice (if you don’t have a lime juicer you can cut the lime in half and use a fork to juice it, I would suggest using fresh lime juice versus lime concentrate), minced ginger (I used prepared ginger), fish sauce, and agave to the bowl.  Stir everything together.  Thinly slice half of a shallot (so they look like thin rings) and add the shallot to the dressing.</li>
              <li>Reserve the dressing and add to the cabbage right before serving as adding it too far in advance will cause the cabbage to lose its crunchy texture.  Toss the dressing in the cabbage mixture making sure everything is evenly coated.</li>
            </ul>

          <p class="wine-text">
            Because of the Asian flavors and spice of this dish, the best wine
            pairing is a Gewurztraminer. I found a California Gewurztraminer
            that was very fruit forward (hints of pear and honey) that was not
            sweet. If you’re feeling red, we also paired a low acid, low tannin
            red blend from California with this dish.

    <p class="post-description">
      A favorite of mine during the cold winter months.  This recipe uses local vegetables and very little ingredients.  This dish does take a while to braise but you can get this going and go relax with a glass of wine (or a few) while the beef is braising.  A couple of things worth mentioning: 
      <ul class="no-list">
        <li>You will want to select a beef roast that has decent marbling and connective tissue such as a chuck roast.  Definitely stay away from sirloin or some other lean meat (and also those pre-cut stew chunks you see at the grocery store).</li>
        <li>Using really fancy wine is not necessary, nor do you even need to use a burgundy in this dish.  I used random leftover reds and a $3.99 merlot from Whole Foods which worked just as well.</li>
        <li>This dish can be served with any type of starch you would like - you can serve it over mashed potatoes or egg noodles.  I usually just serve it in a bowl with some crusty bread.</li>
        <li>I used a le creuset braiser to make this one pot dish, but you can use a Dutch oven or cast iron.</li>
      </ul>

    <p class="instructions">
      <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
        <li>Let the chuck roast come close to room temperature and cut it into 2-3 large chunks.  Grab a paper towel and pat down the meat and season generously with salt and pepper (roughly 2-3 tbsp of each).</li>
        <li>Lightly sear the chuck roast pieces with about 1 tsp of olive oil (I used the medium heat setting on the gas stove) and set aside in a bowl after you’re done searing.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <!-- End of Recipe Section -->
          <!-- Copy and Paste as needed -->
  <div class="instructions instruction-section">​The sautée & the braise</div>
  <p class="instructions">
    <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
      <li>Now add the carrots, radishes, and onion to the pot and sautée them with about 1 tsp of butter and a tsp of salt and pepper, keeping the heat on medium or turn it down if it’s getting too hot.  After the vegetables get some good color, add the cognac and scrap all the brown bits in the bottom of the pot and incorporate into the cognac and the vegetables.  Cook until the cognac evaporates.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile the vegetables are cooking with the cognac, cut the roast pieces into smaller pieces (about 2 inch pieces).</li>
      <li>Once the cognac is cooked down, add the pieces of chuck roast, tomato paste, bay leaves, herbes de provence, mushroom seasoning/beef bouillon, and red wine.  Add enough red wine to almost cover the beef.  Let the stew come to a soft boil, put the lid on, and turn the heat down to medium low (do not let the stew come to a boil but rather a simmer; low and slow is the key here).  The process of braising the vegetables and beef will take anywhere from 2-3 hours; if you’re in a rush you can always crank up the heat but I would advise against that.</li>
      <li>I periodically check on the stew every 30-45 minutes to make sure that the stew isn’t boiling over or going crazy and poke at the pieces to check on the tenderness; you’re looking for something that is tender but not exactly falling apart.  You will alo want to taste the broth to ensure that it is seasoned properly; if you feel it needs more salt, add more mushroom seasoning or beef bouillon in 1 tsp increments.  When the beef is close to being done, you’ll need to get started on the mushroom/onion garnish.  Grab a frying pan and turn the heat to medium.  Then you will take your slice of bacon and slice them into match stick like pieces and add them to the frying pan (make sure the bacon doesn’t burn).  Add the mushrooms (slice the larger ones in half) and the pearl onions to the bacon and cook for about 10 minutes or until the mushrooms are golden and the onions are soft but still have some texture.</li>
      <li>Once your beef is done braising add the bacon/mushroom/onion mix to the stew and voilà your’e done!  Garnish with some parsley and serve with some crusty bread or over some mashed potatoes.</li>

      This recipe serves 4 and approximate cook and prep time is 1.5 hrs - the beauty of this dish is the rice does not need any tending while it’s doing its magic. Shrimp is optional, if you just want to make chicken paella, you can omit the shrimp.

    <p class="wine-text">Since the paella is both poultry and seafood and originated in Spain, I decided to pair it with a Rioja that I picked up from Costco (bottle was a steal at $19.99) and paired exceeding well. This wine will benefit from allowing it to breathe for a bit longer since it is a 1999 and made with Tempranillo grapes. Had this been a seafood paella only, I would chosen a lighter red as this one is a little full bodied for only seafood.

      Every year my best friends (coincidentally also bankruptcy attorneys) and I put together this event called Meat Fest since we always buy an obscene amount of meat - last year was a whole steer and the previous year was one lamb and one goat and this year it was 30 chickens and the "gourmet pig package".  We're not actually gluttons, we're just really supporting our friend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stw01987/">Sean</a> in moving up through the rungs of the Houston Live Stock Rodeo.  
      
      We were very hopeful that Meat Fest 2020 would be unscathed from COVID19 but unfortunately we were not able to put on our epic display of gluttony in person so we decided to do it virtually.  While not exactly the same, it was still amazing to be together and to cook together.   Here are the recipes that we used and some snippets from our virtual cookoff:

      So this may not be the most traditional way to smoke pork spare ribs and maybe even sacrilegious to BBQ buffs but you know what, this recipe definitely works if you want BBQ ribs and you don’t necessarily wait around all day tending to them.  Also, full disclosure, but we have a wifi Tragaer which makes smoking meats one thousand times easier because I can monitor the temperature and timing while being outside of the house.  This recipe was created out of sheer convenience with little to no sacrifice as to the quality of the product.
    </p>
    <p class="post-description">
      Most barbecue recipes from what I’ve seen call for this 3 2 1 method where ribs are smoked for 3 hours unwrapped, then wrapped for 2 hours, and then sauced for 1 hour. This recipe is, let’s say, more of a 3 2 method and instead of smoking and then wrapping them, I did the reverse of smoking them while wrapped at a lower temp, and then unwrapping and saucing simultaneously and turning up the heat to get that nice bark. The sauce I used to glaze the porks for step “2” is a char siu inspired sauce, or Chinese barbecue sauce.

  <h3 class="wine-rec">Leftovers???</h3>
  <div class="wine-pairing">
    <p class="wine-text">
      In the off chance that you have leftovers, you can always try your hand at making char siu baos which are DELICIOUS.  You’ve seen them at dim sum restaurants and while somewhat laborious to make, it’s pretty fun if you have some helping hands.  If you have leftover ribs, you just need to cut the rib meat off the bones and dice up the meat and throw the leftovers into a sauce pan and add just enough chicken stock to revitalize the rib meat (the sauce should not be too thin and you want the consistency to be like a pulled pork sandwich).  <a target="_blank" href=" https://rasamalaysia.com/char-siew-bao/">This</a> is the best dough recipe I have found and it is pretty forgiving.

        <!-- Copy and Paste as needed -->
    <p class="instructions">
      <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400F. Take your beets and wash them and try to scrub off as much of the dirt as possible and trim off the end of the beet to remove that root and wrap your beet(s) in aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Once your oven hits 400F, put your beet(s) in the oven and roast them for an hour or until they are fork tender and set the beets aside (you can do this days in advance and the beets will actually keep in the foil for a few days until you’re ready to use them). If you’re in a hurry to get this done you can always throw the beets in the freezer to cool them down quickly.</li>
        <li>After the beets have cooled off, start peeling the skin of the beets. If the skin is hard to peel, just use a paring knife to remove the skin. Also, if you’re using red beets, you may want to put on some disposable gloves so you don’t stain your hands but based on my experience, roasting beets this way has caused minimal staining (but in this case I used golden beets so no problem there).</li>
        <li>Take the beet(s) and thinly slice them using a mandoline or a knife. I sliced them almost paper thin using 1/16 thickness and set aside in a boil and toss the beets with 1 tsp of sesame oil and 1 tsp of soy sauce.</li>
        <li>Now take your English cucumber and thinly slice half of it using a mandoline or knife to about the same thickness as the beet(s). You can use however much of the cucumber based on your personal preference of beet to cucumber ratio. Take your slice cucumbers and put them in a bowl or colander and throw about 1 tbsp of salt on them and let them hang out for about 10 minutes, after that time you’ll notice that the cucumbers are almost sweaty (this is good because you’ll want to get rid of as much moisture as possible for maximum crunchiness). While the cucumbers are sweating it out, you can thinly slice your shallot and your radishes. After about 10 minutes, take a paper towel or kitchen towel and wring the moisture from the cucumbers and place them in a bowl along with your sliced shallots and radishes and add 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar, and 1 tbsp sesame oil (you can adjust the amount of soy sauce and vinegar based on personal preference).</li>
        <li>Chiffonade the mint leaves or you can rip them up for a rustic look and add about half to the cucumber mixture and reserve the rest for the garnish. Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOOdQiTBPGs">video</a> on how to do that fancy slicing.</li>
        <li>As for the presentation, you can arrange how I did in the photo by doing alternating layers of beet and cucumber/radish/shallot or you can toss everything together and garnish with the chiffonade mint.</li>

      I bought these ribeye steak cap steaks from Snake River Farms and decided this was as good as any time to cook these up and no regrets!  This recipe was made for 2 using 1 6oz steak served with farro risotto and mushrooms, and potato pave.

  <div class="instructions instruction-section">FPreparation of the Steak</div>
    <p class="instructions">
      <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
        <li>Take your steak and season it liberally with salt (I used Himalayan salt but any salt will do).</li>
        <li>Add the steak to your food saver bag/sous vide bag (if you don't have this you can always use a ziploc bag and double bag it just in case) and then add the sliced garlic, sprigs of thyme and rosemary and the secret ingredient shhhh---duck fat and then seal the bag.</li>
        <li>Place the bag into your sous vide machine or if you have the sous vide wand, add it to a pot of water with a sous vide wand with the temperature set at 124F for very rare.  For cooking times and temperatures, I usually defer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak.html">here</a> for guidance.  I like my steak on the very rare side so you may want to aim at 130 for a medium rare since you will be searing this steak later on.</li>
        <li>Sous vide the steak for about 1 1/2 hours - you could let it go for longer if you're busy prepping other dishes probably probably no longer than 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Take the steak out of the bag and pat dry, set aside while you crank up your stove in order to give your steak a good sear (almost everyone coming out of the sous vide does not have the most appetizing color or texture so this part is imperative).  You can either use a cast iron pan or a really good non stick pan to do the sear.  When the pan is hot, add about 1 1/2 tbsp of clarified butter (I use clarified butter for the higher smoking and the flavor it imparts (smoking point of clarified butter is 482F compared to the smoking points of butter and canola oil, 302F and 400F, respectively), and then sear your steak for 1 minute on each side for a nice crust on the steak.  I also baste the steak in the butter and added the herbs from the sous vide to impart even more flavor.  Set the steak aside and wrap loosely in aluminum foil to keep it warm while you work on the wine reduction sauce and turn down the heat on the pan to around a medium, maybe medium low.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="instructions instruction-section">wine reduction/mushroom sauce</div>
    <p class="instructions">
      <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
        <li>Using the same pan that you seared the steaks, add the sliced shallots and cook for about 1 minute and make sure not to burn them but just to soften them up a bit and then add about 1/2 a package of enoki mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Cook the shallots and mushrooms for about a minute and then add 1 tsp of thick soy sauce or dark soy sauce and then add 1/2 cup of red wine (I used a red Tuscan but you can use whatever red wine that you like to drink that isn't super expensive).</li>
        <li>You just let the wine reduce until it is able to coat the back of a spoon and you're done!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="instructions instruction-section">Wheat Farro Risotto with Cremini Mushrooms</div>
    <p class="instructions">
      <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
        <li>Chop the cremini mushroom into about quarters and saute in a pan with about 2 tbsp of butter and saute until light brown.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup of farro and brown for about 2 minutes and stir to move the farro around in order to toast it and then add 1/4 cup of sake to the farro and cook until the sake almost evaporates.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp of miso paste and 2 tbsp of thick soy sauce and add 2 cups of chicken stock (or vegetable stock to keep it vegetarian/vegan) and turn the heat down to about a medium to a medium low - you'll want the farro to bubble away but not too vigorously.  The wheat farro takes a while to cook and this dish probably took about 1 hour since I kept the heat pretty low.  You'll know the farro is down when the farro is al dente and if you run out of chicken stock you just need to keep adding more stock.</li>
        <li>Right when the risotto is done, add about 3 tbsp of heavy cream for some extra richness (or omit in order to make this dish vegetarian/vegan).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="instructions instruction-section">Potato Pave</div>
    <p class="instructions">
      <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
        <li>I buy vegetables from a local co-op and had a surplus of small yukon gold potatoes which was the inspiration for this dish.   It is better to use russet potatoes as it makes for a better presentation.  I used 5 small potatoes but you can use 2 large russet potatoes.</li>
        <li>For this recipe, I left the skin on the potatoes and did not peel them since most of the nutrients of a potato but it is much prettier when you peel the potatoes.  Take your potatoes and using a very sharp knife or mandolin (an amazing gadget!), slice the potatoes to about a 1/16 inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Take a baking dish (a loaf pan would work the best, you want a dish that has tall sides because the wow factor of this dish is from the many, many layers of potato) and spray it with cooking oil and start assembling your potato layers.</li>
        <li>Add a thin layer of salt and pepper per 3 layers - it is easy to oversalt these potatoes which is why I only did every 3 layers.  Also when assembling the layers, I chose slices of similar widths so each potato unit looked uniform (the benefit of using a large russet potato is that you can cut the slices into rectangles or squares for ease of assembly).</li>
        <li>When you're done assembling, pour enough heavy whipping cream over top of the potatoes just so there is about 1/2 inch of liquid in the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake the potatoes in an oven at 400F for 30 minutes uncovered and then cover it with foil and bake for another 30 minutes.</li>
