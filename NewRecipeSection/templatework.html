    <p class="post-description">
      I bought these ribeye steak cap steaks from Snake River Farms and decided this was as good as any time to cook these up and no regrets!  This recipe was made for 2 using 1 6oz steak served with farro risotto and mushrooms, and potato pave.

    <div class="recipe-section">
        <!-- Copy and Paste as needed -->
  <div class="instructions instruction-section">FPreparation of the Steak</div>
    <p class="instructions">
      <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
        <li>Take your steak and season it liberally with salt (I used Himalayan salt but any salt will do).</li>
        <li>Add the steak to your food saver bag/sous vide bag (if you don't have this you can always use a ziploc bag and double bag it just in case) and then add the sliced garlic, sprigs of thyme and rosemary and the secret ingredient shhhh---duck fat and then seal the bag.</li>
        <li>Place the bag into your sous vide machine or if you have the sous vide wand, add it to a pot of water with a sous vide wand with the temperature set at 124F for very rare.  For cooking times and temperatures, I usually defer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak.html">here</a> for guidance.  I like my steak on the very rare side so you may want to aim at 130 for a medium rare since you will be searing this steak later on.</li>
        <li>Sous vide the steak for about 1 1/2 hours - you could let it go for longer if you're busy prepping other dishes probably probably no longer than 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Take the steak out of the bag and pat dry, set aside while you crank up your stove in order to give your steak a good sear (almost everyone coming out of the sous vide does not have the most appetizing color or texture so this part is imperative).  You can either use a cast iron pan or a really good non stick pan to do the sear.  When the pan is hot, add about 1 1/2 tbsp of clarified butter (I use clarified butter for the higher smoking and the flavor it imparts (smoking point of clarified butter is 482F compared to the smoking points of butter and canola oil, 302F and 400F, respectively), and then sear your steak for 1 minute on each side for a nice crust on the steak.  I also baste the steak in the butter and added the herbs from the sous vide to impart even more flavor.  Set the steak aside and wrap loosely in aluminum foil to keep it warm while you work on the wine reduction sauce and turn down the heat on the pan to around a medium, maybe medium low.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="instructions instruction-section">wine reduction/mushroom sauce</div>
    <p class="instructions">
      <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
        <li>Using the same pan that you seared the steaks, add the sliced shallots and cook for about 1 minute and make sure not to burn them but just to soften them up a bit and then add about 1/2 a package of enoki mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Cook the shallots and mushrooms for about a minute and then add 1 tsp of thick soy sauce or dark soy sauce and then add 1/2 cup of red wine (I used a red Tuscan but you can use whatever red wine that you like to drink that isn't super expensive).</li>
        <li>You just let the wine reduce until it is able to coat the back of a spoon and you're done!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="instructions instruction-section">Wheat Farro Risotto with Cremini Mushrooms</div>
    <p class="instructions">
      <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
        <li>Chop the cremini mushroom into about quarters and saute in a pan with about 2 tbsp of butter and saute until light brown.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup of farro and brown for about 2 minutes and stir to move the farro around in order to toast it and then add 1/4 cup of sake to the farro and cook until the sake almost evaporates.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tbsp of miso paste and 2 tbsp of thick soy sauce and add 2 cups of chicken stock (or vegetable stock to keep it vegetarian/vegan) and turn the heat down to about a medium to a medium low - you'll want the farro to bubble away but not too vigorously.  The wheat farro takes a while to cook and this dish probably took about 1 hour since I kept the heat pretty low.  You'll know the farro is down when the farro is al dente and if you run out of chicken stock you just need to keep adding more stock.</li>
        <li>Right when the risotto is done, add about 3 tbsp of heavy cream for some extra richness (or omit in order to make this dish vegetarian/vegan).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="instructions instruction-section">Potato Pave</div>
    <p class="instructions">
      <ul class="instruction-list no-list">
        <li>I buy vegetables from a local co-op and had a surplus of small yukon gold potatoes which was the inspiration for this dish.   It is better to use russet potatoes as it makes for a better presentation.  I used 5 small potatoes but you can use 2 large russet potatoes.</li>
        <li>For this recipe, I left the skin on the potatoes and did not peel them since most of the nutrients of a potato but it is much prettier when you peel the potatoes.  Take your potatoes and using a very sharp knife or mandolin (an amazing gadget!), slice the potatoes to about a 1/16 inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Take a baking dish (a loaf pan would work the best, you want a dish that has tall sides because the wow factor of this dish is from the many, many layers of potato) and spray it with cooking oil and start assembling your potato layers.</li>
        <li>Add a thin layer of salt and pepper per 3 layers - it is easy to oversalt these potatoes which is why I only did every 3 layers.  Also when assembling the layers, I chose slices of similar widths so each potato unit looked uniform (the benefit of using a large russet potato is that you can cut the slices into rectangles or squares for ease of assembly).</li>
        <li>When you're done assembling, pour enough heavy whipping cream over top of the potatoes just so there is about 1/2 inch of liquid in the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake the potatoes in an oven at 400F for 30 minutes uncovered and then cover it with foil and bake for another 30 minutes.</li>
      </ul>

      This dish with all the accompaniments is fairly rich and would best pair with a bold red.  A bold California cab would have paired best, but alas we did not have any chilled so we  went with a Burgundy instead.
